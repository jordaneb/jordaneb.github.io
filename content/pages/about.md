I’m Jordan Brown, a Senior Full‑Stack Engineer. I build product‑driven software, and I like writing about the bits that get me curious — especially electronics, low‑level systems, self‑hosting, and the occasional AI experiment.

This site is intentionally simple. It’s a place to keep notes on projects, lessons learned, and useful setups I’d want to reference later.

If you want to reach me, GitHub is the best place to start: https://github.com/jordaneb
